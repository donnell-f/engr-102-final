
### Pente
a simple, checkers-like terminal game.

---

Rules of Pente:
- Players alternate turns placing stones of their color.
- You can capture opponent pieces by flanking exactly two of their pieces with two pieces of your own.
  - (e.g. "XOOX" --> "X__X").
- You can win by making five captures or placing five stones in a row.
- Additionally, feel free to interrupt the control flow using these "Menu... " prompts:
  - instr: display these instructions again.
  - quit: quit the game early.
  - score: display score.
  - (blank): continue with the normal flow of the game

(This was a final project that I made in collaboration with Vaidehi Singhal, Caleb Glover, and Christian Reyna for my ENGR 102 class.)
